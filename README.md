# Titanic-Passenger-Data-Analysis

Overview

This repository provides tools and datasets for analyzing the Titanic passenger manifest. The dataset includes details about passengers such as their demographics, ticket information, and survival status. The aim is to explore factors that influenced survival and provide insights through data analysis and visualization.

Dataset

The dataset contains multiple features describing passengers and their experience on the Titanic. Example columns include:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.

Survived: Survival status (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive).

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
